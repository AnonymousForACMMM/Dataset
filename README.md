Change detection datasets

The S2Looking dataset will be uploaded to Baidu network disk and Google Drive in November AFTER the competition at rsaicp.com.

NOTE: Any cheating on the competition would not be tolerated! The competition teams will be required to re-implement their results with spot supervision and any cheating organisation would be excluded from the follow-up projects.
